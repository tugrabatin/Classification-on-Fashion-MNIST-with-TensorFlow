# Classification-on-Fashion-MNIST-with-TensorFlow-TensorFlow-Quantum-and-Cirq

* Inside the Repository, you'll find implementations of both a Quantum Neural Network and a Classical Convolutional Neural Network designed for performing classification tasks using the well-known Fashion MNIST dataset.
* For the Quantum Implementation, TensorFlow-Quantum and Cirq are used.
* For the Classical Implementation, TensorFLow 2.x and TensorBoard are used.
* The Jupyter Notebooks are developed in Google Colab.
* The TensorBoard Visualization used in Classical Implementation may or may not work in other environments like Kaggle. Therefore, it is recommended to run it in Google Colab.
* The Repository contains weights for trained Classical and Quantum Models.
